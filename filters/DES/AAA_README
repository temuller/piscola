
These filters are based on the Y3A2 standard bandpasses
including the standard atmosphere. 

Default is "no out-of-band" (noOOB) transmission because
DECAL does not have the sensitivity to measure it, and
because the vendor sample tests show negligible (E-5)
OOB trans.

There is also a set including out-of-band (OOB) meausured
by DECAL. We expect this to be an over-estimate, but this
should be used as as conservative systematic check.

UPDATE 11/9/2017 - AB OFFSETS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM HERE BECAUSE
          AB OFFSETS HAVE BEEN APPLIED IN THE Y3A2 STELLAR CATALOGS

UPDATE 7/17/2018 - previous transmissions included instrument only;
                   now fixed to include atmosphere.
